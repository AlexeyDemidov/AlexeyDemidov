Most of the public repos here are forks of Chef cookbooks and some ruby gems.

There are some examples of my own code that I can publish:

* [BigDoor REST API ruby client library](https://github.com/AlexeyDemidov/bigdoorkit-ruby) - clean code still showing A score on codeclimate.com

* [IP Accounting script](https://gist.github.com/AlexeyDemidov/1064420) utilizing Radix tree algorithms. This implementation sped up ISP accounting cycle from 8 hours during the night to less than one hour.

* [An ancient C daemon](https://github.com/AlexeyDemidov/fidod) - monitor a directory for new files (there was no `inotify` at the time and it was running on FreeBSD anyway)
* [Another ancient C daemon](https://github.com/AlexeyDemidov/avsmtpd) - SMTP proxy daemon to pass all mail through drwebd antivirus from times when there was no milter interface for postfix.
